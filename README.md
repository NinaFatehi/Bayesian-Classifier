# Bayesian-Classifier
In this repository, two Bayesian classifiers (Naive Bayes and
k-NN) are trained to predict the presence of heart disease in the patient based on the Cleveland database. This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them, such as age, sex and several medical predictor variables.
